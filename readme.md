# repo-man

A console application that helps with understanding how healthy a codebase is. 

## OVERVIEW
repo-man contains several actions that can be run from the command line to help you understand the health of your codebase.
The first argument you pass to the executable should be the action you want to take (similar to the dotnet CLI usage pattern).

### diagram
```
.\repo-man.exe diagram --repo "C:\path\to\your\git\repo" --type="commits" --maxRadius 100 --outputDir "C:\path\to\output\folder" --background "white" --fileName "diagram.svg" --ignoreFileTypes "png|jpg|bmp"
```
The diagram action generates an SVG file visually representing the files in your git repository. 
Each circle represents a file, and the size of the circle is proportional to the size of the file. 

#### diagram types 
There are two types of diagrams you can generate: "commits" and "risk". Here is how they differ: 
if you select the "commits" diagram, you will see the intensity of the color deepen for files with more commits. 
If you select the "risk" diagram, you will see the intensity of the color deepen for files with a higher ""risk index", 
which is a weighted value that takes into account several different factors: 
* the size of the file in bytes
* the number of commits made against the file
* the total (cyclomatic) complexity of the file (SonarQube)
* the number of critical issues found in the file (SonarQube)
* the number of major issues found in the file (SonarQube)
* the number of code smells found in the file (SonarQube)

* Files are shown in the folder structure of the repository. Here is a diagram of the repo-man repository:

#### Config options

When you wish to generate a diagram, your first argument should be "diagram".
Below are additional configuration keys (case-sensitive) that can be passed at the command line (or included in the appSettings config):

- **repo (required)** - relative or absolute folder path to the git repository you want to diagram (the folder containing the .git folder)
- type - the type of diagram to generate. Defaults to "commits", which bases the color intensity on the number of commits. You can also specify "risk" which will gather SonarQube code quality metrics and base the color intensity on the file's risk index.
- sqProjectKey - the SonarQube project key for the repository. If you are generating a "risk" diagram, you must provide this key so the tool can gather the necessary metrics.
- maxRadius - by default, diagrammed files have a radius range of 10 to 100. All of the file sizes in your repo are charted on that scale. If you have a wide disparity in file sizes, you may want to set the maxRadius lower so you can see the very small files better. Setting the maxRadius to 10 will chart all files the same size.
- outputDir - the directory to write the diagram.svg file. Defaults to the git repository root folder.
- background - sets the background color of the svg file. Defaults to "blanchedalmond" üêøÔ∏è.
- fileName - for setting the diagram file name, defaults to diagram.svg
- ignoreFileTypes - a pipe-delimited list of file extensions to ignore from analysis and from the diagram. For example, passing in "png|jpg|bmp" will ignore all image files from the diagram.

### review (alpha version)
```
.\repo-man.exe review --repo "C:\path\to\your\git\repo"
```
The review action pulls historical commit data from the git repository's current branch, and generates a text report to the command line
identifying code quality risks in the repository. The report is generated using AI to analyze the data, and is intended to be a starting
point for further investigation. The report is still early days, but with some prompt tuning could prove to be valuable. 

### Config options

The review action only requires that you provide a repo path that points to a valid git repository.
repo-man will analyze the repository's current branch and generate a report to the console. 
Right now you must have Ollama installed on your machine to run the analysis. 
The appSettings.json file contains settings for the local Ollama endpoint and the model to use for analysis.
In the future, this may be configured to be more LLM-agnostic and could point to a remote LLM API for better analysis. 

## DEPENDENCIES

- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 8
- Nuget packages: libgit2sharp

## GETTING STARTED

The console project's launchSettings.json is configured to use its own git repo when you run the solution in debug mode, 
so you should be able to clone the repo and run it immediately.

If you want to run it from the command line, navigate to the folder with the executable and run it like this: 

## CONFIG OPTIONS

Because the tool is meant to be run from a command line or batch script, 
the primarily anticipated means of passing options is through command line args, 
but the Microsoft default host builder does set you up with the rest of the typical configuration sources.

When you call the tool from the command line, your first argument should always be the action you want to take, with no key.
Other configuration options should follow in the form of key-value pairs.


## TODO

- feature: change the intensity of the file color based on how recently it was modified if option passed in
- feature: change the intensity of the file color based on how many commits it has if option passed in
- feature: incorporate some sentiment analysis for the commit messages to determine how many commits are bug commits, and use that in the risk index
