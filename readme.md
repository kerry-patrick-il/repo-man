# repo-man

A console application that generates diagrams helping users to visualize the codebase

## TODO
=> implement IFileColorMapper
* TDD out SvgComposer 
* feature: user can specify background color
* feature: implement ignored file extensions for binary file types (png, jpg, bmp, etc.)
* 

## NOTES
* Rather than trying to capture every single file extension, let's only include the file extensions we're concerned about (known code file extensions)
